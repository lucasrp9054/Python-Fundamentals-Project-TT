# Project 1: Python Fundamentals

## Overview

This project represents the first practical application of fundamental Python concepts, serving as a foundation for more complex data analysis in the following sprints. The main focus was on manipulating different data types, using control structures, and implementing programming logic to solve basic problems.

## Skills and Tools Applied

In this project, the following essential Python skills were practiced:

- **Data Types:** Manipulation of numeric types (`int`, `float`), logical (`bool`), text (`string`), and collections (`list`).
- **Type Conversion:** Using functions like `int()`, `str()`, and `float()` to convert data between different types.
- **String Handling:** 
    - Formatting with *f-strings*
    - Changing case with `.upper()` and `.lower()`
    - Removing spaces with `.strip()`
    - Replacing characters with `.replace()`
- **Data Structures:** Using lists to store and access collections of values through indexing and slicing.
- **Control Logic:**
    - Implementing `for` loops to iterate over list elements.
    - Using `while` loops to execute code blocks until a condition is met.
    - Creating branches in the code with conditional statements `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing `try-except` blocks to handle possible runtime errors and prevent the program from crashing.

## Conclusion

This project was a fundamental step in solidifying knowledge of Python syntax and basic structures, laying the groundwork for data manipulation and analysis with specialized libraries in future projects.
