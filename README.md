# Python-Fundamentals-Project-TT

This project serves as the first practical application of fundamental Python programming concepts, developed as part of the TripleTen Data Science bootcamp. The main goal was to perform data quality assessment and cleaning on a sample of customer data from an e-commerce company, "Store 1." This foundational work prepares the data for future analysis and demonstrates core programming skills.
